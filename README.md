# Introduction

Trapped inside a haunted home, the player will need to solve puzzles in order to
find a way out. This project makes use of the Unreal Game Engine and the Blueprint
coding language to simulate an interactable environment for the player to explore.

# Description

Users jump straight into the escape room and are able to control a simulated
player character, represented by a camera viewpoint and invisible mesh that detects
collisions. Using directional inputs mapped to arrow keys (or WASD keys) on the
keyboard, and mouse movement and inputs via the left and right mouse buttons,
players are able to move and explore their environment, pick up objects, inspect
objects, and otherwise interact with certain physical models in predictable ways. Objects
that are able to be manipulated by the player are indicated with an outline when looked
at, a small widget, or a combination of both. Small textual hints and visual clues are
scattered throughout the level, in order to give the player a sense of direction.
